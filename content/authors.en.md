### Original version

This lab was built to run on Qwiklabs in 2018. In 2020 it was rewritten and updated to run outside Qwiklabs.

A special thanks goes to Regis Gimenis ([regisgimenis](https://github.com/regisgimenis)) who is the original designer of the hands on workshop. He did one of the most difficult tasks - creating a lab from scratch. Remnants of Regis' work are found throughout the Python files of the workshop and the lab guide. Without him, this site would not exist.
