## Challenge: Create New Views

The SQL editor window is provided so that you have an easy way to run queries and 
experiment with data transformation techniques.

Using the sample queries as a guide, see how many techniques you can combine in a single query.
Look for opportunities to align attributes across the table so that they can be queried by a GSI. 
Consider using date fields in column two, so that they become Sort Key values, and be queryable with 
DynamoDB range queries.

1. When you have a SQL statement you like, click the CREATE VIEW button.
2. In the prompt, enter a name for your new view. This will add a CREATE VIEW statement to the top of you query. 
3. Click RUN SQL to create the new view. 
4. Refresh the page, and your view should appear as a button next to the vCustOrders button.
