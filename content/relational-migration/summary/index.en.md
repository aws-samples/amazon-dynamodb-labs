Congratulations! You have completed the Relational Migration to DynamoDB workshop.
You learned how to approach a migration project, what features, tools and script are available to help you, 
and gained hands-on experience with the components of an end-to-end custom migration job.

If you are running this event in your own account, be sure to terminate the Cloudformation stack
that launched the workshop, to avoid any unexpected charges. 

You used scripts and tools from the /workshops/relational-migration folder in the
[github.com/aws-samples/aws-dynamodb-examples](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-dynamodb-examples/) repository.
