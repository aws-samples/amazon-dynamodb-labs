## Three phases
You can tackle a migration project by breaking it into three distinct phases.

1. **Schema Refactoring**: Defining new tables and indexes to replace existing ones
2. **Data Migration**: Transforming and moving historical data into DynamoDB tables, with minimal downtime
3. **App Refactoring**: Replacing SQL calls with DynamoDB read and write calls

The workshop will cover each challenge in turn.
