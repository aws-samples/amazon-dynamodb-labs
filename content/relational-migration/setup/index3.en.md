### Create Tables, Views, and Load Data

For your convenience, a single script can setup and populate the relational database schema.

1. From the Cloud9 terminal, run

```bash
./setup_tables.sh
```

This will create a set of tables, a SQL view, and fill the tables with sample records.
You can re-run this at any time to reset the starting relational environment.

### Congratulations!
Your starting environment has been setup and you now have the following components.
