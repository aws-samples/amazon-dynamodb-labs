### Starting Environment
Let's get the workshop environment setup, so we can begin planning the migration.

Here are the resources that have already been deployed for you in your AWS account.

This environment may look similar to what you have already in your organization!
You likely have a developer desktop or laptop, 
the ability to find and clone the public Github code repository,
and a running MySQL database instance.
You can create a new Amazon S3 bucket quickly, which can be used as a staging area for data to be migrated.
