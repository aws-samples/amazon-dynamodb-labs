## NoSQL Design: Bank Payments Scenario

A bank has asked you to develop a new backend system to handle their scheduled payments.

This is primarily an OLTP workload with daily batch processes. Items in the table(s) represent payments that are scheduled between accounts.  As items are inserted, they are scheduled on a specific date to have the payment processed. Each day, items are regularly sent to a transactional system for processing, at which time their status changes to `PENDING`. Upon a successful transaction, an itemâ€™s status is set to `PROCESSED` and updated with a new transaction ID.

#### Workload dimensions

- Accounts can have multiple payments scheduled for any day in the future.
- Payments have the following data fields: *AccountID*, *ScheduledDate*, *Status* (`SCHEDULED`, `PENDING` or `PROCESSED`), *DataBlob* (total item size is <= 8 KB)
- One million automated scheduled payments are added every day at 1:00 AM *for that day*, which need to complete in 30 minutes.
- One million payments are added every day with the `SCHEDULED` state, mostly in the hours of 6 AM to 6 PM.
- During the day, a batch job runs regularly to query for today's `SCHEDULED` payments. This service sends the `SCHEDULED` items to the transaction service. Upon sending the items to the transaction service, the payment status is changed to `PENDING`.
- When the transaction service completes, the status of an item is changed to `PROCESSED` and a new transaction ID is added to the item.
- Items need to be returned for a specific account that are scheduled for payment in the next 90 days.
- The transactional service has to retrieve all items for a specific date (for example, today) across all accounts. It has to be able to retrieve items that are specifically `SCHEDULED` or `PENDING`.

**Your Challenge:** Develop a NoSQL data model for the bank that fulfills the scheduled payments requirements.

**Bonus challenge:** At the end of each day, all of the items that were `PROCESSED` need to be moved to a long term table (due to compliance the data needs to be in a separate table). Design a second data model that fulfills that same access requirements as above, and add another requirement to return a specific item associated with a transaction ID.
