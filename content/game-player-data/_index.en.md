In this workshop, you will learn advanced data modeling patterns in [Amazon DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html). When using DynamoDB, it is important to consider how you will access your data (your access patterns) before you model your data. You will go through an example multiplayer gaming application, learn about the access patterns in the gaming application, and see how to design a DynamoDB table to handle the access patterns by using secondary indexes and transactions.
