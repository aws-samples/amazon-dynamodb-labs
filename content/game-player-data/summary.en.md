In the previous modules, the following access patterns in the gaming application were handled:

- Create user profile (Write)
- Update user profile (Write)
- Get user profile (Read)
- Create game (Write)
- Find open games (Read)
- View game (Read)
- Join game for a user (Write)
- Start game (Write)
- Update game for a user (Write)
- Update game (Write)
- Find games for user (Read)

The strategies used to satisfy these patterns include:
- A single-table design that combines multiple entity types in one table.
- A composite primary key that allows for many-to-many relationships.
- A sparse global secondary index (GSI) to filter on one of the fields.
- DynamoDB transactions to handle complex write patterns across multiple entities.
- An inverted index (GSI) to allow reverse lookups on the many-to-many entity.
