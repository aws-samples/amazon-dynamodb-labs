In this workshop, we will review Amazon DynamoDB design patterns and best practices to build highly scalable applications that are optimized for performance and cost. We will demonstrate the implementation of these design patterns using Python scripts. At the end of this workshop, you will have the knowledge to build and monitor DynamoDB applications that can grow to any size and scale. Here's what you'll find in this workshop:
- Setup
- Exercise 1 - Capacity Units & Partitioning
- Exercise 2 - Table Scan and Parallel Scan
- Exercise 3 - GSI write sharding
- Exercise 4 - GSI key overloading
- Exercise 5 - Sparse Indexes
- Exercise 6 - Composite keys
- Exercise 7 - Adjacency Lists
- Exercise 8 - DynamoDB Streams and AWS Lambda


### Target audience

This session is designed for developers, engineers, and database administrators who are involved in designing and maintaining DynamoDB applications.

### Requirements
