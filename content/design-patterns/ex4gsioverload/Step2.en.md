Now, execute a script that loads the data from the file named `./employees.csv` into the table named `employees`.

```bash
python load_employees.py employees ./data/employees.csv
```

The sample `employees.csv` record looks like the following:
```csv
1000,Nanine Denacamp,Programmer Analyst,Development,San Francisco,CA,1981-09-30,2014-06-01,Senior Database Administrator,2014-01-25
```
When you ingest this data into the table, you concatenate some of the attributes, such as `city_dept` (example: San Francisco:Development) because you have an access pattern in the query that takes advantage of this concatenated attribute. The `SK` attribute is also a derived attribute. The concatenation is handled in the Python script, which assembles the record and then executes a `put_item()` to write the record to the table.

Output:
```txt
$ python load_employees.py employees ./data/employees.csv
employee count: 100 in 3.7393667697906494
employee count: 200 in 3.7162938117980957
...
employee count: 900 in 3.6725080013275146
employee count: 1000 in 3.6174678802490234
RowCount: 1000, Total seconds: 36.70457601547241
```
The output confirms that 1000 items have been inserted to the table. 

Review the `employees` table in the DynamoDB console (as shown in the following screenshot) by choosing the **employees** table and then choosing the **Items** tab.

On the same page in the right pane, choose **[Index]** from the dropdown menu and then click **Start search**.

Now you can see result of "Scan" opration on overloaded global secondary index. There are many different entity types in the result set: a master, a previous title, and a current title.
