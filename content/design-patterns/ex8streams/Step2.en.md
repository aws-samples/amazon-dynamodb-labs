TODO : Craig has some questions but I think we are good. he wqas not sure if this is policy or role? 

We have precreated the IAM role `DDBReplicationRole` that will be used in this exercise. This IAM role allows the AWS Lambda to read from the DynamoDB Streams. 
Review the following policy which is attached to the IAM role DDBReplicationRole.
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "dynamodb:DescribeStream",
                "dynamodb:GetRecords",
                "dynamodb:GetShardIterator",
                "dynamodb:ListStreams"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "dynamodb:DeleteItem",
                "dynamodb:PutItem"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "logs:CreateLogGroup",
                "logs:CreateLogStream",
                "logs:PutLogEvents"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow"
        }
    ]
}
```

These are two of the permissions granted to the Lambda function in the policy:

- The Lambda function can put and delete items only in the `logfile_replica` table.
- â€¢ Log events are published to Amazon CloudWatch Logs (but in this lab they are not available).
