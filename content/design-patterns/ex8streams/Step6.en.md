Run the Python code to load more items into the table:
```bash
python load_logfile.py logfile ./data/logfile_stream.csv
```
Output:
```txt
RowCount: 2000, Total seconds: 15.808809518814087
```

#### Verify replication

You can scan the table **logfile_replica** to verify that the records have been replicated. It takes a few seconds, so you may need to repeat the following command until you get the records. Once again, use the up-arrow to repeate the previous command.
```bash
aws dynamodb scan --table-name 'logfile_replica' --max-items 2 --output text
```
You will see the first 2 items of the replica table as follows:
```txt
None    723     723

**Note**: *Your log entries may differ. So long as you have two log entries, you've verified successful replication. If you don't see any entries, re-run the load_logfile.py command - you may have run the inserts too soon after creating the AWS Lambda function.*

## Congratulations, you have successfully completed all the exercises in the workshop.
{{% notice warning %}}
If you ran the lab on your own AWS account, you should delete all of the tables made during the course of this exercise. If you are are at an AWS event using the AWS Workshop platform (e.g. Event Engine) then you do not need to delete your tables.
