## Launch the CloudFormation stack
{{% notice warning %}}
During the course of the lab, you will make DynamoDB tables that will incur a cost that could approach tens or hundreds of dollars per day. Ensure you clean up the Amazon DynamoDB tables by deleting the CloudFormation stack as soon as the lab is complete.
{{% /notice %}}

1. Launch the CloudFormation template in US East 1 to deploy the resources in your account:
  <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=amazon-dynamodb-labs&templateURL={{% siteparam "design_patterns_s3_lab_yaml" %}}" target="_blank"><img src="/images/cloudformation-launch-stack.png" alt="CloudFormation"/></a>
  *Optionally, download [the YAML template]({{% siteparam "design_patterns_s3_lab_yaml" %}}) and launch it your own way*

1. Click *Next* on the first dialog.

1. In the Parameters section, note the default option for *VPCSelection* is `CreateNewVPC`. **The `CreateNewVPC` option has the highest chance of success**.  
    If you would like to use your default VPC, change this option to `Default`.  
    Leave the *WorkshopCodeURL* parameter unchanged and click *Next*
![CloudFormation parameters](/images/awsconsole1.png)

1. Scroll to the bottom and click *Next*, and then review the *Template* and *Parameters*. When you are ready to create the stack, scroll to the bottom, check the box acknowledging the creation of IAM resources, and click *Create stack*.
![CloudFormation parameters](/images/awsconsole2.png)
  The stack will create an EC2 lab instance, a role for the EC2 instance, and a role for the AWS Lambda function used later on in the lab.


1. After the CloudFormation stack is `CREATE_COMPLETE`, [continue onto Step 1]({{< ref "design-patterns/setup/Step1" >}}).  
  *If you chose `Default` in the *VPCSelection* dialog and your stack fails to create due to a VPC issue, re-create the stack and choose the default option `CreateNewVPC`*.
