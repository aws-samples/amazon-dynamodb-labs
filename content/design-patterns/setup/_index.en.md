## GETTING STARTED

To start the workshop, follow one of the following depending on whether you are:
- […running the workshop on your own (in your own account)]({{< ref "start-here/user-account/" >}}), or
- […attending an AWS hosted event (using AWS provided hashes)]({{< ref "start-here/aws-event/" >}})

Once you have completed with either setup, continue on to:
