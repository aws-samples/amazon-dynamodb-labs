In this exercise you will load data into DynamoDB tables that are provisioned with different Write/Read capacity units, and compare the load times for different data sets. First, we will load a smaller data set to a table and note down the quick execution times. Next we will load a larger dataset to an under-provisioned table to simulate throttling exceptions. Next, we will simulate the GSI back pressure on a table by creating a table with higher provisioning and a GSI with only 1 WCU. You will be using the "service access log" data.
