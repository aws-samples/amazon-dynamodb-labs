In this exercise, you load data into DynamoDB tables that are provisioned with different write/read capacity units, and compare the load times for different datasets. First, you load a smaller dataset into a table and note the quick execution times. Next, you load a larger dataset into an underprovisioned table to simulate throttling exceptions. Finally, you simulate the global secondary index back pressure on a table by creating a table with higher provisioning and a global secondary index with only 1 write capacity unit (WCU). In this exercise, you use sample web server access log data, similiar to the web server log data generated by Apache.
