First, execute a simple (sequential) Scan to calculate the total bytes sent for all records with **response code <> 200**. You can run a Scan with a filter expression to filter out unrelated records. The application worker will then sum the values of all the returned records where **response code <> 200**.

The Python file, **scan_logfile_simple.py**, includes the command to run a `Scan` with a filter expression and then calculate the sum of bytes sent.

The following code block scans the table.

```py
  fe = "responsecode <> :f"
  eav = {":f": 200}
  response = table.scan(
      FilterExpression=fe,
      ExpressionAttributeValues=eav,
      Limit=pageSize,
      ProjectionExpression='bytessent')
```
**Note:** *You can review the file on your own with ```vim ~/workshop/scan_logfile_simple.py```. Type ```:q``` and hit enter to exit vim.*

Notice that there is a Limit parameter set in the Scan command. A single Scan operation will read up to the maximum number of items set (if using the Limit parameter) or a maximum of 1 MB of data, and then apply any filtering to the results by using FilterExpression. If the total number of scanned items exceeds the maximum set by the limit parameter or the data set size limit of 1 MB, the scan stops and results are returned to the user as a LastEvaluatedKey value. This value can be used in a subsequent operation so that you can pick up where you left off.

In the following code, the LastEvaluatedKey value in the response is passed to the Scan method via the ExclusiveStartKey parameter.

```py
  while 'LastEvaluatedKey' in response:
    response = table.scan(
        FilterExpression=fe,
        ExpressionAttributeValues=eav,
        Limit=pageSize,
        ExclusiveStartKey=response['LastEvaluatedKey'],
        ProjectionExpression='bytessent')
    for i in response['Items']:
        totalbytessent += i['bytessent']
```
When the last page is returned, `LastEvaluatedKey` is not part of the response, so you know that the scan is complete.

Now, execute this code. 

python scan_logfile_simple.py logfile_scan

**Parameters:** Tablename: ```logfile_scan```

**Output**

Scanning 1 million rows of table logfile_scan to get the total of bytes sent
Total bytessent 6054250 in 24.5398740768 seconds

Make a note of the time it took for the scan to complete.
