This exercise will demonstrate the two methods of table scan, sequential and parallel.

Even though DynamoDB distributes a large table data across multiple physical partitions, a Scan operation can only read one partition at a time. For this reason, the throughput of a Scan is constrained by the maximum throughput of a single partition.

In order to maximize the utilization of the table level provisioning, use the Parallel Scan operation to logically divide a table (or secondary index) into multiple segments, and use multiple application workers to scan these logical segments in parallel.
