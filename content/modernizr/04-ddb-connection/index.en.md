## Setting Up DynamoDB Infrastructure

Stage 4 is where you actually implement the DynamoDB side of your dual database system. Think of this as installing the wiring and connections for your second database engine - you're building all the infrastructure needed to make DynamoDB work with your application.

This stage focuses on creating the actual DynamoDB tables, setting up the AWS SDK connections, and implementing the data transformation logic that converts your MySQL data into DynamoDB format.

## What You'll Build

### DynamoDB Table Creation

Using your migration contract as the blueprint, you'll create the actual DynamoDB tables with the exact specifications from your data model:

- **Users Table**: With partition key (PK) and sort key (SK), plus the three GSIs (GSI1, GSI2, GSI3) you designed
- **Products Table**: With its partition/sort keys and two GSIs (GSI1, GSI2)  
- **Orders Table**: With its keys and single GSI (GSI1)

Each table needs to be configured with the right capacity settings, security policies, and monitoring to handle your application's traffic.

### AWS SDK Integration

You'll set up the connection between your application and DynamoDB using the AWS SDK:

- **Connection Configuration**: Setting up the DynamoDB client with proper authentication
- **Region Settings**: Making sure you're connecting to the right AWS region
- **Error Handling**: Building retry logic for when DynamoDB operations fail
- **Performance Tuning**: Configuring connection pooling and timeout settings

### Data Transformation Engine

This is the heart of Stage 4 - implementing the transformation logic that converts MySQL data into DynamoDB items:

- **Attribute Mapping**: Converting MySQL columns into DynamoDB attributes
- **Data Type Conversion**: Handling differences between MySQL and DynamoDB data types
- **Relationship Denormalization**: Flattening relational joins into single DynamoDB items
- **Key Generation**: Creating the partition and sort key values for your items

### Repository Implementation

You'll extend the dual database abstraction layer from Stage 3 to include DynamoDB operations:

- **DynamoDB Repository Classes**: Implementing the same interfaces as your MySQL repositories
- **Query Translation**: Converting your business logic queries into DynamoDB operations
- **Batch Operations**: Using DynamoDB's batch read/write capabilities for performance
- **Transaction Support**: Implementing DynamoDB transactions where needed

## DynamoDB-Specific Challenges

### Working with NoSQL Patterns

Moving from MySQL to DynamoDB requires understanding different data access patterns:

- **No Joins**: Instead of joining tables, you denormalize data into single items
- **Query Limitations**: You can only query on partition keys and sort keys (plus GSIs)
- **Eventually Consistent Reads**: Understanding when you get the latest data vs. slightly stale data
- **Capacity Management**: Planning for read/write throughput instead of just worrying about CPU/memory

### Data Modeling Differences

Your migration contract handles the conversion, but you need to understand what's happening:

- **Composite Keys**: Using PK/SK combinations instead of auto-incrementing IDs
- **Sparse Indexes**: GSIs that only contain items with certain attributes
- **Item Size Limits**: DynamoDB items can't exceed 400KB
- **Attribute Flexibility**: Items in the same table can have different attributes

### Performance Optimization

DynamoDB performs differently than MySQL, so you need to optimize accordingly:

- **Hot Partitions**: Making sure your partition keys distribute data evenly
- **Batch Operations**: Grouping multiple reads/writes for better throughput
- **Projection Management**: Choosing which attributes to include in GSIs
- **Caching Strategy**: Using application-level caching where DynamoDB queries are expensive

## Implementation Strategy

### Start with Basic Operations

Begin by implementing the simple CRUD operations:
- **Create**: Insert new items using PutItem
- **Read**: Retrieve items using GetItem and Query
- **Update**: Modify existing items using UpdateItem  
- **Delete**: Remove items using DeleteItem

### Add Complex Queries

Once basic operations work, implement the more complex access patterns:
- **List Operations**: Using Query with partition keys to get collections
- **Search Operations**: Using GSIs to support different search criteria
- **Batch Operations**: Using BatchGetItem and BatchWriteItem for multiple items

### Testing and Validation

Build comprehensive tests to ensure your DynamoDB implementation works correctly:
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual repository methods with mock data
- **Integration Tests**: Test real DynamoDB operations with test tables
- **Data Consistency Tests**: Verify that transformed data maintains integrity
- **Performance Tests**: Measure response times and throughput

## Why This Foundation Matters

### Solid Infrastructure

By building robust DynamoDB infrastructure in Stage 4, you create a reliable foundation for the migration control system you'll build in Stage 5. If the DynamoDB implementation is shaky, the entire migration process becomes risky.

### Data Integrity

The transformation engine you build here ensures that data moving from MySQL to DynamoDB maintains its accuracy and completeness. This is critical for maintaining user trust during the migration.

### Performance Baseline

Understanding how your DynamoDB implementation performs with real operations gives you baseline metrics to compare against MySQL. This data helps you make informed decisions during the actual migration.

This stage transforms your migration contract from a paper plan into working code that can actually store and retrieve data from DynamoDB. Once Stage 4 is complete, you have a fully functional NoSQL backend ready to be integrated into your migration workflow.
