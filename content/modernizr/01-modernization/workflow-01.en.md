## ðŸ“š Prompt Engineering Architecture

The `/prompts` directory implements a structured approach to AI-driven development through organized subfolders that correspond to each stage of the modernization workflow. Each subfolder contains three components: Requirements, Design, and Tasks documents. This architectural pattern creates a comprehensive framework that systematically guides the entire modernization process from initial analysis through final implementation.

### Requirements Documentation - Defining Objectives and Success Criteria

The Requirements Document establishes the foundational context by articulating the business objectives and technical constraints that drive the modernization initiative. This document defines explicit acceptance criteria and success metrics, creating what software engineers refer to as the "definition of done." By providing comprehensive context about the problem domain, the requirements document enables the LLM to understand not just what needs to be built, but why it needs to be built and how to validate that the implementation meets the specified goals.

### Design Documentation - Technical Architecture and Implementation Strategy  

The Design Document serves as the technical specification that translates high-level requirements into concrete architectural decisions and implementation strategies. This document defines the specific methodologies, data structures, and system workflows that will be employed throughout the modernization process. It includes detailed implementation guidelines, architectural patterns, and design rationale that provide the LLM with a comprehensive technical blueprint for executing the modernization according to established software engineering principles.

### Task Documentation - Executable Implementation Steps

The Tasks Document functions as the bridge between abstract architectural design and concrete implementation by decomposing design specifications into discrete, executable development tasks. This document provides sequenced instructions that reference specific files, tools, and expected deliverables, ensuring the LLM receives actionable directives rather than abstract concepts. The task breakdown transforms architectural decisions into manageable development units that can be systematically executed and validated.

### The Importance of Structured Prompt Engineering

This three-tier documentation approach addresses a fundamental challenge in AI-assisted development: the complexity management problem. When an LLM encounters a sophisticated design document without accompanying task structure, it faces the same challenges that human developers experience when given high-level specifications without clear implementation guidance. The system may attempt to implement multiple components simultaneously, leading to incomplete or inconsistent results, or it may struggle to determine the appropriate sequencing of development activities.

The structured approach provides several advantages. The LLM receives explicit guidance on which specialized tools and MCP servers to utilize for each development phase. Dependencies between implementation tasks become clearly defined, preventing issues that arise from incorrect execution ordering. The system understands exactly what deliverables should be produced at each stage, enabling proper validation and quality assurance throughout the process.

To conceptualize this framework using a navigation analogy: the Requirements document defines the destination and the reasons for traveling there, the Design document provides the comprehensive route map showing all available paths and optimal strategies, and the Tasks document functions as turn-by-turn GPS navigation that guides execution through each specific step of the journey. This structured approach transforms complex modernization challenges into systematic, manageable processes that can be executed reliably through AI-assisted development workflows.
