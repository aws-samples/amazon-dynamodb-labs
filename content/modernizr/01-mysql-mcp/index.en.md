## Comprehensive MySQL Database Analysis

Stage 1 establishes the foundation for your modernization project by conducting a systematic analysis of your existing MySQL database. This phase involves using specialized AI tools to automatically discover and document your current data architecture, relationships, and usage patterns.

The analysis process leverages the MySQL MCP Serverâ€”a specialized AI assistant designed specifically for relational database analysis. This tool connects directly to your running MySQL instance to extract comprehensive metadata about your database schema, including table structures, relationships, indexes, and constraints.

## Key Analysis Components

### Schema Discovery and Documentation

The MySQL MCP Server performs automated schema discovery by querying the MySQL information schema to extract detailed metadata about:

- **Table Structures**: Column definitions, data types, constraints, and nullable fields
- **Primary and Foreign Keys**: Relationship mappings between tables and referential integrity constraints  
- **Indexes**: Performance optimization structures including primary, unique, and composite indexes
- **Views and Stored Procedures**: Complex query logic and business rules embedded in the database

### Data Relationship Mapping

Understanding how your data entities relate to each other is crucial for designing an effective NoSQL structure. The analysis identifies:

- **One-to-Many Relationships**: Parent-child relationships that may benefit from document embedding in DynamoDB
- **Many-to-Many Relationships**: Complex associations that require careful modeling in NoSQL
- **Hierarchical Data Patterns**: Nested structures that can be optimized using DynamoDB's flexible schema

### Access Pattern Analysis

The system analyzes your application's database interaction patterns to understand:

- **Query Frequency Patterns**: Which tables and queries are accessed most frequently
- **Join Operations**: Complex relational queries that need restructuring for NoSQL
- **Transaction Boundaries**: ACID transaction requirements that must be preserved during migration

## Automated Documentation Generation

The MySQL MCP Server generates comprehensive documentation artifacts that serve as reference materials throughout the modernization process:

- **Entity Relationship Diagrams**: Visual representations of your current data model
- **Schema Documentation**: Detailed specifications of all database objects
- **Access Pattern Catalog**: Systematic documentation of how your application interacts with data

## Setting Up the Analysis Environment

Before beginning the analysis, ensure your MySQL database is accessible and the MCP Server has appropriate permissions to read schema metadata. The analysis process is read-only and does not modify your production data.

This systematic approach to database analysis provides the detailed understanding necessary to design an optimal DynamoDB architecture that preserves all existing functionality while improving performance and scalability.
