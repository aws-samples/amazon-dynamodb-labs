### Target audience

This workshop is designed for developers, engineers, and database administrators who are involved in designing and maintaining DynamoDB applications.

### Requirements
#### Basic knowledge of AWS services
- Among other services this lab will guide you through the use of [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) and [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

#### Basic understanding of DynamoDB
- If you're not familiar with DynamoDB or are not participating in this lab as part of an AWS event, consider reviewing the documentation on "[What is Amazon DynamoDB?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html)"

### Recommended study before taking the lab

If you're not part of an AWS event and you haven't recently reviewed DynamoDB design concepts, we suggest you watch this video on [Advanced Design Patterns for DynamoDB]({{% siteparam "latest_rh_design_pattern_yt" %}}), which is about an hour in duration.
