Let's begin by navigating to [AWS cloud9 management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home) and choose *open IDE* to launch AWS Cloud9 environment. You can close the Welcome screen and adjust your terminal to increase screen area, or close all the windows and navigate to *Window* -> *New Terminal* to open a new terminal window.

Then run the command `aws sts get-caller-identity` just to verify that your AWS credentials have been properly configured.
