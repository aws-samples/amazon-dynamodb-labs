In this chapter, we'll cover the prerequisites needed to get started with [Amazon DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html). You'll create a DynamoDB cluster and use a AWS Cloud9 envrironment to query this cluster. You'll also query the cluster using a Python Client Application.
