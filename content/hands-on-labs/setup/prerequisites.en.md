To run this lab, you'll need an AWS account, and a user identity with access to the following services:

* Amazon DynamoDB
* AWS Cloud9 Environment

You can use your own account, or an account provided through Event Engine as part of an AWS organized workshop.  Using an account provided by Event Engine is the easier path, as you will have full access to all AWS services, and the account will terminate automatically when the event is over.

### Account setup

#### Using an account provided through Event Engine

If you are running this workshop as part of an Event Engine lab, please log into the console using [this link](https://dashboard.eventengine.run/) and enter the hash provided to you as part of the workshop.

#### Using your own AWS account

If you are using your own AWS account, be sure you have access to create and manage resources in Amazon DocumentDB and AWS Cloud9 environment

*After completing the workshop, remember to complete the [cleanup](/hands-on-labs/cleanup.html) section to remove any unnecessary AWS resources.*
