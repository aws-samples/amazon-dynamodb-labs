3.  Under “Add permissions” use the search box to find the “AmazonDMSVPCManagementRole” policy and select it, then click “Next”

1. Launch the CloudFormation template in US East 1 to deploy the resources in your account:
  <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=dynamodbmigration&templateURL={{% siteparam "lhol_migration_dms_setup_yaml" %}}" target="_blank"><img src="/images/cloudformation-launch-stack.png" alt="CloudFormation"/></a>
  *Optionally, download [the YAML template]({{% siteparam "lhol_migration_dms_setup_yaml" %}}) and launch it your own way in the [CloudFormation Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create/template)*
9.  Click Next
10. Confirm the Stack Name *dynamodbmigration* and keep the default parameters (modify if necessary)

11. Click “Next” twice
12. Check “I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names.”
1.  Click Submit. The CloudFormation template will take about 15 minutes to build a replication environment. You should continue the lab while the stack creates in the background.
