Welcome to the AWS workshop and lab content portal for **[Amazon DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html)**. Here you will find a collection of workshops and hands-on content aimed at helping you gain an understanding of Amazon DynamoDB features, capabilities, and NoSQL Data Modeling best practices.

The labs on this site include an AWS hands-on lab (Advanced Design Patterns) that is a collection of easy to follow instructions, scripts, and tutorial data. It also includes a collection of data model design challenge scenarios to help you understand the decisions and trade-offs made while building efficient data models.

These resources are focused on helping you discover how to use the advanced features of the Amazon DynamoDB - a cloud native NoSQL database, and apply NoSQL design best practices.

Prior expertise with AWS and NoSQL databases is beneficial, but not required to complete the labs.
