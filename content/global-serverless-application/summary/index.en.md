We hope you enjoyed this workshop and learning about how to build and deploy
global applications! Please feel free to send change requests to [our GitHub issues](:param{key="github_issues_link"}).


If you are running this workshop as part of an AWS sponsored event, your 
temporary account will be destroyed at the end of the event and all the 
resources will be deleted, so there is nothing else for you to do.

If you are running this workshop in your own AWS account, you may
delete the `DynamoDBID` CloudFormation Stack and the Chalice created components to avoid incurring 
any charges afterwards.  The DynamoDB table was created in On Demand mode 
so there are no charges for provisioned capacity levels, only for actual usage. However there will be small charges for storage if the table is not cleaned up.
