## Setup Steps
This lab requires a terminal shell with Python3 and the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) installed and configured with admin credentials.

We will use AWS Cloud9 for this event. [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug code with just a browser. AWS Cloud9 includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. It also comes prepackaged with essential tools for popular programming languages and the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) preinstalled so that you don’t have to install files or configure your laptop for this lab. Your AWS Cloud9 environment will have access to the same AWS resources as the user with which you signed in to the AWS Management Console.

### To set up your AWS Cloud9 development environment:

1. Choose **Services** at the top of the page, and then choose **Cloud9** under **Developer Tools**.
   
2. There will be an environment ready to use under **My environments**.

3. Click on **Open** under **Cloud9 IDE**, and your IDE should open with a welcome note.

You should now see your AWS Cloud9 environment. You need to be familiar with the three areas of the AWS Cloud9 console shown in the following screenshot:

![Cloud9 Environment](/static/images/global-serverless-application/module_1/cloud9-environment.png)

- **File explorer**: On the left side of the IDE, the file explorer shows a list of the files in your directory.
  
- **File editor**: On the upper right area of the IDE, the file editor is where you view and edit files that you’ve selected in the file explorer.
  
- **Terminal**: On the lower right area of the IDE, this is where you run commands to execute code samples.

### Verify Environment
1. Run ```aws sts get-caller-identity``` to verify the AWS CLI is functioning
2. Run ```python3 --version``` to verify that python3 is installed
3. Your Cloud9 environment is already configured with boto3, but for this lab we will also need AWS Chalice.  
Run ```sudo python3 -m pip install chalice``` to install [AWS Chalice](https://github.com/aws/chalice). 

::alert[You may see a couple of WARNING lines near the bottom of the command output, these are safely ignored.]{type="info"}

4. Run ```curl -O https://amazon-dynamodb-labs.com/assets/global-serverless.zip```
5. Run ```unzip global-serverless.zip && cd global-serverless```
6. To see what application resources we will be deploying you can open the **app.py** file by navigating to "global-serverless/app.py" in the file explorer. This code defines Lambda function and API Gateway routes.

### Deploy a new DynamoDB table
1. In your terminal, run:

:::code{showCopyAction=true showLineNumbers=false language=bash}
aws dynamodb create-table \
  --region us-west-2 \
  --table-name global-serverless \
  --attribute-definitions \
    AttributeName=PK,AttributeType=S \
    AttributeName=SK,AttributeType=S \
  --key-schema \
    AttributeName=PK,KeyType=HASH \
    AttributeName=SK,KeyType=RANGE \
  --billing-mode PAY_PER_REQUEST \
  --query '{"New Table ":TableDescription.TableArn, 
            "Status    ":TableDescription.TableStatus }'
:::

2. Wait a moment for the table to be created. 

Check to see when the table status changes from `CREATING` to `ACTIVE` by 
running this command:

:::code{showCopyAction=true showLineNumbers=false language=bash}
aws dynamodb describe-table \
  --table-name global-serverless \
  --region us-west-2 \
  --query '{TableStatus: Table.TableStatus}'
:::

3.Our table is in us-west-2 (Oregon). 
Let's make it a **Global Table** by requesting a replica in eu-west-1 (Europe/Dublin).

Run this command to create a new replica in the eu-west-1 (Europe/Dublin) 
region:

:::code{showCopyAction=true showLineNumbers=false language=bash}
aws dynamodb update-table --table-name global-serverless --region us-west-2 --cli-input-json  \
'{"ReplicaUpdates": [
    {
        "Create": {"RegionName": "eu-west-1" }
        }
    ]}'
:::

Check to see when the table replica status changes to `ACTIVE` by 
running this command:

:::code{showCopyAction=true showLineNumbers=false language=bash}
aws dynamodb describe-table \
  --table-name global-serverless \
  --region us-west-2 \
  --query '{TableStatus: Table.TableStatus,
               Replicas: Table.Replicas}'
:::

4. Next, add some data to the table:
Writing to a Global Table is done by writing to any of the regional replica tables.

Run this command to load video library items into the table with 
batch-write-item:

:::code{showCopyAction=true showLineNumbers=false language=bash}
aws dynamodb batch-write-item \
  --region us-west-2 \
  --request-items file://sample-data.json
:::

These items are how the UI will display which videos are available to stream.


5. Verify data was written:

:::code{showCopyAction=true showLineNumbers=false language=bash}
aws dynamodb get-item \
  --table-name global-serverless \
  --region us-west-2 \
  --key '{"PK": {"S": "library"}, "SK": {"S": "01"}}'
:::

### Deploy the backend API service to the first region

1. Run ```export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2``` to instruct Chalice to deploy into us-west-2 for our first region
2. Run ```chalice deploy``` and wait for the infrastructure to be created. Chalice is a Python based serverless framework.
3. When the script completes, it reports a list of resources deployed. **Copy and paste the Rest API URL into a note as you will need it later.**
4. Copy that REST API URL and paste it into a new browser tab to test it. You should see a JSON response of {ping: "ok"}
5. You can type in certain paths to the end of the URL. Add the word scan so that the URL now ends with ```/api/scan```
 You should see a JSON response representing the results of a table scan.

### Web Application
A single-page static web app is provided for you. 
 * https://amazon-dynamodb-labs.com/static/global-serverless-application/web/index.html
 * This app allows you to enter one or more API endpoints, and stores each one as a browser cookie.  
 * The stored API endpoints will remain in the browser even if the backend were to have problems.  
 * In this way, the web app could make decisions about routing itself to an alternate API if there are errors or no response from the API being used.  
 * The web app does not contain any AWS code nor credentials, it simply makes HTTP GET calls to the API for you.
* The app's web content can be hosted from an S3 bucket, made globally available via Cloudfront, saved locally within Chrome, or converted into a mobile app. For this workshop we assume the user always has access to the web app even if the backend services become unavailable.

Steps:
1. Within the web app, press the **Add API** button.  
2. Paste in the API URL you created previously and click OK.
3. Review the buttons that appear. Click Ping to generate a request to the base level URL. 
The round trip latency will be displayed.  This may be slower than expected do to a Lambda cold start. 
Click Ping again and check the latency.
4. Click the **get-item** button. This will return the bookmark for user100 watching a show called AshlandValley.
5. Click the forward and back buttons. They will generate requests to increment or decrement the bookmark by 1 second.

You now have a test harness where you can perform reads and writes to a DynamoDB record via the custom API.

### Deploy the service stack to the second region, Ireland
1. Run ```export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-west-1``` to instruct Chalice to deploy into eu-west-1 for our second region.
2. Run ```chalice deploy``` and wait for the infrastructure to be created in eu-west-1.
3. When the script completes, it reports a list of resources deployed. Again, copy down the new REST API URL to a note for later use.
4. Return to the web app.
5. Click **Add API** again and paste in the new API URL. A second row of buttons appears in an alternate color.

Note: In this workshop you have permissions for Global Tables in us-west-2 and eu-west-1. 
In your own account you could add any number of replicas in any regions.

Note 2: If you make any changes to the code in ```app.py```, you can push the updates to your Lambda function  
by running ```chalice deploy``` again.
