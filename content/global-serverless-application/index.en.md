weight: 10

## Workshop Overview 

In this workshop you will learn how to build and deploy a globally distributed 
serverless application and get experience with using Amazon DynamoDB Global 
Tables to replicate data across AWS Regions. 

You will use serverless components to build an API to support a video player 
web application. The API service is designed to store bookmark records for 
any video show that a customer watches, so that the application can remember 
where a user left off during a watch session.

The target audience for this workshop is any developer or application architect 
who needs to understand multi-region data availability architectures for their
application. At the end of this workshop you should:

 * Feel comfortable creating a DynamoDB Global Table in multiple regions
 * Understand how DynamoDB Global Tables Replication works
 * Be able to explain what eventual consistentcy means in the context of DynamoDB Global Tables replication

You must bring your laptop to participate and the expected duration of this
workshop is 50 minutes.

- [Getting started](getting_started/)
