::alert[The `MapLambda` function is already connected for you, so let us quickly check if it works as expected!]

Check that `MapLambda` has a correctly configured trigger to receive messages from the `StateTable` stream:

1. Navigate to the AWS Lambda service within the AWS Management Console.
2. Click on the `MapLambda` function to view its configuration.
3. Verify that the `MapLambda` function has a DynamoDB trigger and this trigger points to the `StateTable` (see figure below).

## How do you know it is working?

Any row written to the `StateTable` should trigger the `MapLambda` function. Therefore, you should be able to see logs for the Lambda invocations.

Alternatively, you can observe the outputs of the `MapLambda` function in the DynamoDB `ReduceTable`. To do that, navigate to the DynamoDB service in the AWS console, click `Items` on the left, and select `ReduceTable`. At this stage you should see multiple rows similar to the image below.
