In this module, you will create an environment to host the MySQL database on Amazon EC2. This instance will be used to host source database and simulate on-premise side of migration architecture.
All the resources to configure source infrastructure are deployed via [Amazon CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) template.
There are two CloudFormation templates used in this exercise which will deploy following resources.

CloudFormation MySQL Template Resources:
  - OnPrem VPC: Source VPC will represent an on-premise source environment in the N. Virginia region. This VPC will host source MySQL database on Amazon EC2
  - Amazon EC2 MySQL Database: Amazon EC2 Amazon Linux 2 AMI with MySQL installed and running
  - Load IMDb dataset: The template will create IMDb database on MySQL and load IMDb public dataset files into database. You can learn more about IMDb dataset inside [Explore Source Model](/hands-on-labs/rdbms-migration/migration-chapter03)



CloudFormation DMS Instance Resources:
  - DMS VPC:  Migration VPC on in the N. Virginia region. This VPC will host DMS replication instance.
  - Replication Instance: DMS Replication instance that will facilitate database migration from source MySQL server on EC2 to Amazon DynamoDB
