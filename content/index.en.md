Welcome to the AWS Workshop and Lab Content Portal for [Amazon DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html), a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. Here you will find a collection of workshops and hands-on content aimed at helping you gain an understanding of DynamoDB features and NoSQL data modeling best practices.

The 200-level hands on labs include exercises designed to familarize you with DynamoDB using the CLI and the AWS Management Console. This site also includes a workshop ("Advanced Design Patterns for DynamoDB") that is a collection of easy-to-follow instructions, scripts, and tutorial data. In addition the site includes a collection of data model design challenge scenarios to help you understand the decisions and tradeoffs made while building efficient data models.

Prior expertise with AWS and NoSQL databases is beneficial but not required to complete this workshop.
If you're brand new to DynamoDB with no experience, you may want to begin with *Hands-on Labs for Amazon DynamoDB*. If you want to learn the design patterns for DynamoDB, check out *Advanced Design Patterns for DynamoDB* and the *Design Challenges* scenarios.
