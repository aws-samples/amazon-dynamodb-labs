## Getting Started

To run this lab, you will need an AWS account, and a user identity with access to the following services:

* Amazon DynamoDB
* Amazon Kinesis
* AWS Lambda
* AWS Cloud9 Environment

You can use your own account, or an account provided through Event Engine as part of an AWS organized workshop.  Using an account provided by Event Engine is the easier path, as you will have full access to all AWS services, and the account will terminate automatically when the event is over.

To set up this workshop, choose one of the following links, depending on whether you are:
- :link[Attending an AWS-hosted event (using AWS-provided access codes)]{href="/change-data-capture/setup/aws-ws-event/"}
- :link[Running the workshop on your own (in your own account)]{href="/change-data-capture/setup/user-account/"}
