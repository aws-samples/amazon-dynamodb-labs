In this workshop, you will learn how to perform change data capture of item level changes on DynamoDB tables using [Amazon DynamoDB Streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.html) and [Amazon Kinesis Data Streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/kds.html). This technique allows you to develop event-driven solutions that are initiated by alterations made to item-level data stored in DynamoDB.

Here is what this workshop includes:

### Target audience

This workshop is designed for developers, engineers, and database administrators who are involved in designing and maintaining DynamoDB applications.

### Requirements
#### Basic knowledge of AWS services
- Among other services this lab will guide you through the use of [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) and [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

#### Basic understanding of DynamoDB
- If youâ€™re not familiar with DynamoDB or are not participating in this lab as part of an AWS event, consider reviewing the documentation on "[What is Amazon DynamoDB?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html)"


### Recommended study before taking the lab

If you're not part of an AWS event and you haven't recently reviewed DynamoDB design concepts, we suggest you watch this video on [Advanced Design Patterns for DynamoDB](:param{key="latest_rh_design_pattern_yt"}), which is about an hour in duration.
