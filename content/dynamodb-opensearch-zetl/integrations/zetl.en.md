Amazon DynamoDB offers a zero-ETL integration with Amazon OpenSearch Service through the DynamoDB plugin for OpenSearch Ingestion. Amazon OpenSearch Ingestion offers a fully managed, no-code experience for ingesting data into Amazon OpenSearch Service. 

 1. Open [OpenSearch Service Ingestion Pipelines](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/aos/home?region=us-west-2#opensearch/ingestion-pipelines)
 1. Click "Create pipeline"

 1. Name your pipeline, and include the following for your pipeline configuration. The configuration contains multiple values that need to be updated. The needed values are provided in the CloudFormation Stack Outputs as "Region", "Role", "S3Bucket", "DdbTableArn", and "OSDomainEndpoint".

 1. Under Network, select "Public access", then click "Next".

 1. Click "Create pipeline".

 1. **Wait until the pipeline has finished creating**. This will take 5 minutes or more.


 After the pipeline is created, it will take some additional time for the initial export from DynamoDB and import into OpenSearch Service. After you have waited several more minutes, you can check if items have replicated into OpenSearch by making a query in Dev Tools in the OpenSearch Dashboards.
 
 To open Dev Tools, click on the menu in the top left of OpenSearch Dashboards, scroll down to the `Management` section, then click on `Dev Tools`. Enter the following query in the left pane, then click the "play" arrow.

```text
GET /product-details-index-en/_search
```
You may encounter a few types of results:
- If you see a 404 error of type *index_not_found_exception*, then you need to wait until the pipeline is `Active`. Once it is, this exception will go away.
- If your query does not have results, wait a few more minutes for the initial replication to finish and try again.

Only continue once you see a return like the above, with a response body. Your hits may vary.
