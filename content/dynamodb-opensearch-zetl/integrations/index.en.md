In this section, you will configure integrations between services. First you will set up machine learning (ML) and Pipeline connectors in OpenSearch Service. Then you will setup a zero-ETL connector to move data stored in DynamoDB into OpenSearch for indexing. Once both these integrations are set up, you'll be able to write records to DynamoDB as your source of truth and then automatically have that data available to query in the other services.
