Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI, Stability AI, and Amazon via a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities you need to build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI.

In this application, Bedrock will be used to make natural language product recommendation queries using OpenSearch Service as a vector database. We will use the Titan Embeddings G1 for text embeddings and Claude Haiku for generative AI.

Bedrock no longer requires models to be explicitly enabled, so we have nothing to configure here!
